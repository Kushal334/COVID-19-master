# Question 1)
Download the COVID-19 case distribution (in XML formal): https://opendata.ecdc.europa.eu/ covid19/casedistribution/xml/. Load the XML file into a browser or text editing tool and inspect it. Explore the data set as you see fit and get a sense of the data. Note that you are working with a live dataset that is updated daily. Therefore it is best to ensure that your results are data driven

# Answer 1) 

SAMPLE from xml file:

<records>
  <record>
    <dateRep>08/06/2020</dateRep>
    <day>8</day>
    <month>6</month>
    <year>2020</year>
    <cases>791</cases>
    <deaths>30</deaths>
    <countriesAndTerritories>Afghanistan</countriesAndTerritories>
    <geoId>AF</geoId>
    <countryterritoryCode>AFG</countryterritoryCode>
    <popData2018>37172386</popData2018>
    <continentExp>Asia</continentExp>
  </record>
  
-> Components:

1) Date: day/month/year
2) Case: no. of new cases/per day
3) Deaths: no. of deaths /per day
4) Countries and Territories: country full name
5) geoID: 2 digit ISO Code
6) Country Territory Code: 3 digit ISO Code
7) Population Data: 2018 census data
8) Continent: cotinent name

-> How many DBs are used in this?
1) COVID 19: new cases and deaths
2) Population
3) World country DB: ?ISO to divide world into continent followed by country territory, country name and geoID?


# Question 2)
Load the data into R (directly from the URL) and create two linked tibbles: one for country and the other for covid_19_data that contains each countryâ€™s reported case. The country tibble should contain the following: countriesAndTerritories, countryterritoryCode (primary key), popData2018, continentExp. The covid_19_data tibble should contain: id (auto incremented value that will serve as the primary key), countryterritoryCode(foreign key), dateRep, cases, deaths. You can link/join both tibbles by using the countryterritoryCode

# Question 4)
Create visualizations that show the progression of the cases and the mortality rate in each continent.

# Answer 4)

Visualisation:in each continent : to add population of each countries in that continent

    1. progression of case: to add no. of cases of each countries in that continent
    
    2. mortality rate: deaths/population: to add no. of deaths of each countries in that continent divide by population


```{r}
# Mortality Rate is displayed in the scientific form rather than numeric. This is ? due to Population data is converted into intger type??? Checked and rechecked many times - that's the reason!! Quite surprising, weird and annoying! Converting it back to 'factor' and then, will use as.integer() in the codes.

```

** ANALYSIS of Mortality Rate (per 100,000 population) and Progression of Cases: Continent-wise:

1) Africa: 
Eventhough being the second largest continent, Africa has not crossed more than 10,000 cases per day. Mortality rate is controlled well under 0.05. Whether the numbers are less because of undocumented cases or les screening compared to other continents? Or it is so because of the warm climate? Other theory can also be because Africa has Malaria as endemic disease and people have consumed medicine Chloroquine that has been restricting or rather decreasing 'virulence' of the disease? Deeper studies required...

2) America:
This continent seems to be worst hit amongst all continents with number of cases goign as high as 80,000 per day. Currently USA, BRAZIL, PERU are amongst top 10 worst hit countries. The graph also suggests that, as number of cases increases, the mortality rate also increases. As the number of cases crosses 30,000 mark, the mortality rate remains between o.3 to 0.4. The highest mortality recorded for this continent is 0.55  

3) Asia:
Considering that Asia is the largest continent and highest population compared to America and Europe continents, still the number of cases have not crossed 40,000 per day. Eventhough the disease started in Asia, relatively low number of cases than America and lower mortality rate (0.02-0.03 - similar to Africa) indicates well-controlled measures and management in containing the disease.  

4) Europe:
Europe was the worst hit continent when the pandemic started spreading. The graph shows steep rise of mortality compared to America's graph. America and Europe - both continents have almost similar mortality rate, but the major diofference is number of cases per day. That means with less number of cases, deaths were more - attributed to more senior population residing in Europe. That's why the 'virulence' of the diseases seems more in Europe. This is more evident when we comapre Europe and Asia, where both continents have similar number of cases yet major difference is mortality rate (0.7 being the highest in Europe v/s 0.02-0.03 in Asia)  

5) Oceania:
Australia and New Zealand contributing to major population of Oceania, but the countries are less densely populated makes common measure of social distancing possible. This seems to be the major contributor to control the disease and avoid spread. The continent seems to be less affected by the disease. New Zealand recently declared that it is free from the disease.   

6) Others: Japanese Cruise-ship: 
This graph is of the Japanese Cruise-ship that had COVID-19 positive patient and the disease spread in the ship. Total passengers plus crew were around 3000. The data suggests that the ship had very less mortality rate inspite of all patients and passengers were strangled inside the ship and affected around 700 passengers.

## Question 5)
Display the ten countries with the highest number of cases. Analyze the data and indicate the date of the first reported case and the ratio of cases-to-fatalities for each country (use supporting visualizations)

# Answer 5)

- sum(cases)
- group_by(countries)
- descend()
- first date of the first reported case ? how to display?
- the ratio of cases-to-fatalities for each country: deaths/cases: cumulative?.. has to be cumulative as asked for highest number of cases
- visualisation: bar chart for cases and line for ratio? or both lines?

    mutate("case_to_fatalities" = ((deaths / cases)*100)) %>% 
    # adding new column in the tibble by calculating the Ratio of case-to-fatalities: generally considered as per 100: https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dsepd/ss1978/lesson3/section3.html

# Questions 8)
Select a country, of your choice, and use the casesByCountry() function to show the progression of the total COVID-19 cases to-date. Analyze the chart and the supporting data; indicate the total number of cases that were reported and the date of the first reported case. What is the current trend?
â€¢ Based on your analysis for this country, what are the potential impact on countries like Andorra and San Marino. Create visualizations to support your analysis and/or add other supporting dataset(s) if necessary.

# Answer 8)

   1. show the progression of the total COVID-19 cases to-date    
   2. Analyze the chart and the supporting data
   3. indicate the total number of cases that were reported
   4. indicate the date of the first reported case
   5. the current trend?
   6. what are the potential impact on countries like Andorra and San Marino
   7. Create visualizations to support your analysis and/or add other supporting dataset(s) if necessary.


-> Examine the progression of the virus in a country of your preference. Then look at Andorra and San Marino and pay close attention to the information that is provided to you about these two countries/territories. Then explain the effect that the trends you observed in your preferred country, could have on Andorra and San Marino (should similar patterns emerge).

-> It may also be helpful to examine the continent that the two countries/territories are located, and if you examine the progression of the virus in a neighboring country, it may become clear why the potential impact is of importance.

** ANALYSIS: ITALY:

  - Total Population: 60,431,283

  - First Case Reported: January 31, 2020
  
  - Total Cases till date (06/14/2020): 236,305 (0.39% of population)
  
  - Total Deaths till date (06/14/2020): 34,223
  
  - Highest one-day new cases: 6,557

Progression of cases:
Within 3 weeks of first reported case, the number of cases started rising. In the second week of March, the number of cases started increasing 'exponentially' displaying steep rise in the graph. Reaching it's peak on March 22 with 6,557 cases in a single day. High number of cases (4,000 and above) remained for four weeks continuous and then showed 'gradual' decline. Italy considered as one of the top-most healthcare system couldn't sustain this high influx of cases resulted into complete break-down of the healthcare system. 

The disease took 7 weeks to reach to the peak, remained in peak phase for four weeks, and now almost since 9 weeks it is in declining phase. The country is still registering new cases daily ranging between 150-400.

# ANDORRA:
Andorra is the sixth-smallest nation in Europe, having an area of 468 square kilometres (181 sq mi) and a population of approximately 77,006. The Andorran people are a Romance ethnic group of originally Catalan descent. Andorra is the 16th-smallest country in the world by land and the 11th-smallest by population. Andorra is a tiny country in south western Europe, located in the eastern Pyrenees mountains and bordered by "Spain" and "France". 

** Andorra had the highest life expectancy in the world at 81 years, according to the Global Burden of Disease Study


```{r}
caseByCountry("AND")
```

** ANALYSIS: ANDORRA:

  - Total Population: 77,006

  - First Case Reported: March 3, 2020
  
  - Total Cases till date (06/14/2020): 853 (1.1% of population)
  
  - Total Deaths till date (06/14/2020): 51
  
  - Highest one-day new cases: 79

The Trend:
The first case reported on March 3 and reached its peak in 3rd week. the peak phase lasted for about 3 weeks and then cases started declining gradually. May month remianed silent comparatively and there's a sudden spike of 79 cases (highest one day total) on June 3, 2020. This might be the reason that these cases were diagnosed in May month, but reporting done on June 3?

With 853 cases, we can say that around 1.1% of the population got infected with the disease. This is usually an issue with the country having small population. The imapct is larger comapred to countries with high popualtion. If we consider Mortality rate (which is counted with 100,000 as denominator), even with one death, it will create bigger impact on the ratio. Again, this is evident looking at Mortality rate graph that indicates Andorra mortality of upto 5.5 against neigbouring countries France and Spain (Mortality rate of 2)

With 51 deaths out of 853 cases, Death to Case Ratio of Andorra is around 6, while France (18) and Spain (12) showed much higher death to case ratio.

# SAN MARINO:
San Marino, officially the Republic of San Marino, also known as the Most Serene Republic of San Marino, is a country in Southern Europe completely enclosed by "Italy". It is one of only three countries in the world to be completely enclosed by another country. It is the third smallest country in Europe, after Vatican City and Monaco, and the fifth smallest country in the world. San Marino covers a land area of just over 61 km2 (24 sq mi), and has a population of 33,562


```{r}
caseByCountry("SMR")
```


** ANALYSIS: SAN MARIO: Compare with neighbouring country: Italy

  - Total Population: 33,785

  - First Case Reported: February 28, 2020
  
  - Total Cases till date (06/14/2020): 703 (2.1% of population)
  
  - Total Deaths till date (06/14/2020): 42
  
  - Highest one-day new cases: 36

The Trend:
The first case reported on February 28 i.e. 4 weeks after the frist case reported in Italy. and reached its peak in 3rd week of March. It was at the same time, where cases in Italy were at peak and registered its highest one-day cases on March 22. The country continues showing high pillars (high number of cases) intermittently unlike the neighbouring country (Italy) that is showing a definite declining trend.   

With 703 cases, we can say that around 2.1% of the population got infected with the disease. This is usually an issue with the country having small population that we mentioned in analysis of Andorra. The imapct is larger comapred to countries with high popualtion. Again, this is evident looking at Mortality rate graph that indicates Andorra mortality of upto 17.5 against neigbouring country Italy (Mortality rate of less than 2)

With 36 deaths out of 703 cases, Death to Case Ratio of San Marino is around 6, while Italy (14) showed much higher death to case ratio.
